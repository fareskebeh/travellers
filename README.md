# Travellers

Find your people on the same path. Travellers helps you meet verified folks heading to your destination around the same timeâ€”safely and for free.

## What it is
Upload your ticket privately, get verified, and discover other travellers bound for the same place and dates. Only verified profiles can see one another for overlapping trips.

## Contributing
Open source and community-built. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` to get started.

## Safety, simply
- Tickets are used only for verification and never shown to others
- Verified-only visibility for overlapping trips
