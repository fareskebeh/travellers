# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to help:

## Setup
- Install Node.js 18+
- `npm install`
- `npm run db:push`
- `npm run dev`

## Pull requests
- Create a feature branch
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Add tests when changing logic
- Run lint: `npm run lint`

## Commit messages
- Use conventional commits when possible (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)

## Code style
- TypeScript strict
- Server Components by default; Client Components only when needed
- Keep components small and accessible
